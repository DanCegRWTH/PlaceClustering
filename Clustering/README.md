# Clustering
This folder contains the newly introduced steps in the thesis, as well as a post-processing step. To interact with our implementation, follow the installation guide stated below and use the Jupyter Notebook file `Method.ipynb`.

Example place files are given in `place_files\`.

## Installation
1. Install python (in case of errors, I used version 3.12.7)
2. Create virtual environment:
    ```
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate the environment
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
