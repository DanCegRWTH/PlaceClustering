# Representing Conflicting Process Variations: Heuristically Extracting Place Groups for Model Composition
This code is part of the thesis `Representing Conflicting Process Variations: Heuristically Extracting Place Groups for Model Composition` conducted at the Chair of Process and Data Science (PADS) at RWTH Aachen University.

It consists of two parts: an adjusted version of the [eST-Miner in ProM](https://github.com/promworkbench/SPECpp) (by leah-tgu) that is able to generate HTML files of places (go to [SPECpp](./SPECpp/) for more information), 
and a Python implementation of the model splitting and model selection steps as presented in the thesis (go to [Clustering](./Clustering/) for more information.

Example place files used in the evaluation are also provided if one is only interested in testing the Python implementation.
